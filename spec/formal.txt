    signed integer
        i8
        i16
        i32

        int = i64

    unsigned integer
        u8

        u32
        u64
        uint = u64

    boolean
        bool = single byte

    floating point
        f16
        f32
        f64
        float = f64

    pointer
        fn() -> ()      pointer to function
        ^(let/mut) T    pointer to type T
        ^(let/mut)      raw pointer, behaves like a ^(let/mut) u8, but cannot be dereferenced

    untyped
        (untyped_int)   internal int literal - can implicitly convert to any numeric type (if in range)
        (untyped_float) internal float literal - can implictly convert to any float type, or an int type if it represents an integer value (12.0 for example)

    compound
        [N]T            concrete array type with determined length at compile-time
        [](let/mut) T   slice of array defined as struct {raw: ^(let/mut) T, len: uint}

        struct {}       record type
        union {}        sum type (basically a struct with no offset between fields)

        enum T {}       enumeration over type T (default: int). T must be in (all integers, uintegers)

    misc
        distinct        modifier to create an isolated type. this overrides mars' structural equality.

    note: types are the same if they are structurally equivalent. two types defined the same wayt

operators
    binary numeric
        +       addition                with type T in (all integers, uintegers, floats, pointers): <T> + <T> -> <T>

        ||      boolean or              with type T in (bool): <T> || <T> -> <T>

    comparison
        ==      equality                (*): <T> == <T> -> <bool>
        !=      inequality              (*): <T> != <T> -> <bool>

        * a type T is comparable if it is a:
        | base, non-compound type (all integers, uintegers, floats, bool, pointers)

        | union with comparable variants
        | array with comparable element type
        | slice with comparable element type

        ** a type is orderable if it is a:

        | enum with a numeric backing type

        note: entities can ONLY compare with others of the same type, no mixing.

    unary numeric
        -       negation (0 - x)        with type T in (all integers, uintegers, floats): - <T> -> <T>
        ~       bitwise complement      with type T in (all integers, uintegers, floats): ~ <T> -> <T>

    unary boolean
        !       boolean not             with type T in (bool): !<T> -> <T>

    unary conversion
        cast(T)     value cast to type T        cast(T) <X> -> <T>
        bitcast(T)  raw data cast to type T     bitcast(T) <X> -> <T>

        cast() rules:
        | all types can cast to themselves.
        | all (u)integer types can cast between each other.
        |       if one is casting to another of smaller size, the most-significant "top" bits are discarded
        |       casts between (u)integers of the same size behave the same as bitcasts
        | all pointer types can cast between each other
        | all pointer types can cast to u64/uint
        | all (u)integer types can cast to floating point types, converting to their closest floating point representation
        | all floating point types can cast to (u)integer types, truncating and mapping to their closest representation
        | enums have the same casting characteristics of its backing type
        | structs may be cast to other structs if their field type structure is identical (all fields in the same order with the same types).
        | ^ this is identical to a bitcast, but is more deeply checked by the compiler.
        | slices can cast to pointers corresponding to their backing type. a slice of type T can cast to pointer of type T (same thing as appending '.raw')

        note: casting a let pointer to a mut pointer is allowed (generates a warning), but dereferencing it is undefined behavior.

        bitcast() rules:
        | values can be bitcast if their byte sizes are the same.
        | bitcasting does not modify the value data of a variable,
        | but only changes what type the data is interpreted as.

        note : the ONLY types that can cast implicitly are:
        | ^mut   -> ^(mut/let) (T)
        | ^mut T -> ^let T
        | ^let   -> ^let T
        | ^let T -> ^let
        | enum T -> T
        |
        | (u/i)N -> (u/i)M where N, M âˆˆ {8, 16, 32, 64}, N <= M
    
    unary reference
        &       generate pointer        using type T in (all): &<T> -> <^T>
        ^       dereference pointer     using type T in (all): <^(let/mut) T>^ -> <T>
    
    unary type info
        sizeof(T)           get the size of a type. takes a type expression or value expression, returns an untyped integer. the type must not be untyped.
        alignof(T)          get the alignment characteristics of a type. takes a raw type expression, returns an untyped integer. the type must not be untyped.
        offsetof(T, field)  get the offset of a field from an entity's base address. only works for struct and union types.
    
    index
        [n]     index array             using type T in (any array, pointer, slice) and type A (any int, uint, enum) : <T>[<A>]

    slice
        [:]     generate slice          using type T in (any array, pointer, slice) and type A (any int, uint, enum) : <T>[:], <T>[<A>:] <T>[:<A>], <T>[<A>:<A>]


    selector
        .       field/variant selection
        ->      return value selection
        ::      entity from library selection

        the selectors operate like so:
        | access fields from a struct or a struct pointer: a_struct.field
        | access fields from a union or a union pointer: a_union.field
        | access variants of enums. can be implicitly typed where the type can be otherwise derived : an_enum.variant, .variant
        | access hidden fields of a slice: a_slice.raw, a_slice.len
        |
        | access a single return value from a multiple-return-value function: some_function()->return_val
        |
        | access entities from other modules: a_module::something

    
    /* function - might get removed, i dont think its worth it
        inline  inline a function call - only works with compile-time-constant functions contained in the current module
    */

    if/switch
        if      ternary expression              using type T in (all) : if <bool> do <T> else <T>
        when    comp-time ternary expression    using type T in (all) : when <bool> do <T> else <T>
        switch  switch expression               using type T and C in (all) : switch <C> {case <C>: <T>, case <C>: <T>, ...}
        which   comp-time switch expression     using type T and C in (all) : which <C> {case <C>: <T>, case <C>: <T>, ...}

    precendence
        unary operators have highest precedence after atomic expressions (selection, array index, pointer deref, function call)

        non-unary operator precedence. 
        6   *   /   %   %%  &   <<   >>  ~|
        5   +   -   |   ~
        4   ==  !=  <   >   <=  >=
        3   &&
        2   ||
        1   if  when  switch  which

        operators of the same precedence are evaluated left-to-right.
        ex. a * b / c == (a * b) / c

    compound assignment
        +=      addition                variable of type T in (all integers, uintegers, floats, pointers): T += T
        -=      subtraction             variable of type T in (all integers, uintegers, floats, pointers): T -= T
        *=      multiplication          variable of type T in (all integers, uintegers, floats, pointers): T *= T
        /=      division                variable of type T in (all integers, uintegers, floats, pointers): T /= T
        %=      modulo (truncated)      variable of type T in (all integers, uintegers, floats, pointers): T %= T
        %%=     remainder (floored)     variable of type T in (all integers, uintegers, floats, pointers): T %%= T
        &=      bitwise and             variable of type T in (all integers, uintegers, floats, pointers): T &= T
        |=      bitwise or              variable of type T in (all integers, uintegers, floats, pointers): T |= T
        ~|=     bitwise nor             variable of type T in (all integers, uintegers, floats, pointers): T ~|= T
        ~=      bitwise xor             variable of type T in (all integers, uintegers, floats, pointers): T ~= T
        <<=     left shift              variable of type T in (all integers, uintegers, floats, pointers): T <<= (all uintegers)
        >>=     right shift             variable of type T in (all integers, uintegers, floats, pointers): T >>= (all uintegers)

    IMPORTANT: expressions are evaluated left-to-right, depth-first.
        this must be followed in case of functions that may modify variables used in the expression,
        such as `modify_x(&x) + x` or something like that.

name mangling
    global entity names should be mangled like so:
        (module name).(entity name)
    an entity "func" in module "example" would have the link name:
        example.func

entities

    programs are made from modules. modules must be wholly contained within one directory, with one module per directory.

    programs must begin with a module declaration:

        module module_name;

    entity declarations must follow this:

        let name : type = value; // constant value declaration
        let name = value; // derived type from value
        
        mut name : type; // mutable value declaration
        mut name : type = ---;
        mut name : type = value;
        mut name = value; // derived type from value

    global values must be declared with a compile-time constant value.

    other modules can be imported as libraries.

        import lib_name "path/to/module";

    the entity name does not have match the module's internal name. modules may not have import cycles.
    
    entity names must be unique and cannot shadow entities from lower scopes. this is not allowed:

        mut x = 3;
        {
            mut x = 4; // not allowed, x already declared
        }
    
control flow: (anywhere {} is used, a 'do stmt;' pattern can also be used);

    if expr {}
    if expr {} else {}
    if expr {} else if expr {} ... else {}

    // compile-time if: each scope is the same as the outside scope
    when expr {}
    when expr {} else {}
    when expr {} else when expr {} ... else {}

    while expr {}
    while {} // loop forever

    for simple_stmt; expr; simple_stmt {} // if (expr) is not present, defaults to 'true'
    for ident in range_expr {}
    for ident: type in range_expr {} // only if both items in (range_expr) can implicitly cast to (type)

    switch expr {
    case const_expr: // each case has its own scope and implicit break
    case const_expr, ..., const_expr:
    case const_expr: fallthrough; // explicit fallthrough
    case:
    }

    // compile-time switch: each scope is the same as the outside scope
    which expr {
    case const_expr: // implicit break
    case const_expr, ..., const_expr: // multiple cases in one
    case:
    }

    NOTES:
        - constant expressions ('const_expr') are expressions that are constant at compile-time. 
        - simple statements ('simple_stmt') are one of:
            declarations
            assignments
            expression statements
